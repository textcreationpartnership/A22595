            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>And therefore for the effecting of the premisses, Wee doe hereby make knowne Our Royall Will and Pleasure to be, and doe straightly Charge and Command, That no person or persons whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, shall hereafter Import, Conuey, or bring into this Our Realme of <hi>England,</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> from forraine Parts beyond the Seas, any manner of Purles, Cutworkes, or Bouelaces, or any Commodities laced or edged therewith, to be here sold or put to sale, vpon paine of the forfeiture of the same to be seized and taken to Our vse.</p>
            <p>And the better to find out such forraine Purles, Cutworkes and Bonelaces, as shall be hereafter secretly brought into this Realme, and put to sale to the preiudice of Our owne people that make the like; We doe hereby require, aswell all and euery Our Subiects, makers of the said Purles, Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, and Bonelaces, as the sellers and retaylers of the same; That they or any of them, doe not hereafter buy, sell, or put to sale any of the said Manufactures, before the same shall be duely sealed or marked by Our welbeloued Subiect <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> gentleman, or his deputies, whom we ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And in recompence of the attendance of the said Officer, and his deputies in the premisses, We haue Assigned, and granted him the Fee mentioned in Our said Letters Patents: And to the end that the Sealing of the said Purles, Cutworkes, and Bonelaces so made within this Realme, may be done with ease to Our Subiects, We haue authorized the said <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> to appoint deputies in all such Market Townes and other places of this Our Realme, as he shall thinke meete for the Sealing thereof: Vnto whom We doe hereby appoint, that the Seales by him, or them affixed on the said Manufactures, shall be duely returned againe after the Sale thereof, that so all deceipts in making vse of those sealings for other of the like Manufactures, may be the better auoided: And We will that none other shall Seale, or presume to counterfeite the marking, or sealing of the same. And further, for the discouery of the fraudes that may be practized in the premisses, We doe hereby will and require, that all Shopkeepers, now vsing the trade of buying and selling of Purles, Cutworkes, and Bonelaces, or other commodities laced, or Edged therewith, shall produce and permit all such of the said Manufactures either Forraine, or home-made as they are now possessed of, to be Sealed by the said <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> or his deputies as afore said, who is foorthwith to Seale the same at the Owners Shops, without any fee to be payed in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>And Our will and pleasure is, that all such buyers, or gatherers of the said Manufactures, as vsually bring vp the same to Our Citie of London, or places adioyning, to vtter and sell there, shall bring the said Purles, Cutworkes, and Bonelaces to a house next adioyning to the signe of the Red-Hart in Forestreete without Cripple-Gate in London, where the said <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> or his deputie, is to attend the sealing of the same, before it be vttered or put to sale, vpon paine of Our heauie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and such punishments and penalties, as shall, or may be inflicted, for the contempt, or neglect of Our will and Commandement in that behalfe.
